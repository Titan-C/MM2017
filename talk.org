VO_2 is a very interesting transition metal oxide because it displays
a Metal insulator transition close to room temperature. Making it
attractive for novel electronic devices. Explaining this transition
remains a challenging endeavor, between our hand waving arguments to our
most sophisticated bandstructure calculations great progress has been
made to describe this material but not enough to settle the debate
about the origins of its transition. VO_2 is a correlated metal at
high temperature and one would argue for Mott transition to justify
the insulator, where electrons localize due to the strong Coulomb
repulsion they experience between eachother. Nevertheless at the
transition temperature the crystal structure changes from rutile to
Monoclinic and dimers form and inspire an alternative justification
where the insulating behavior is attributed to this spin-Peierls
structural instability.

For our study we trade the complications of the real crystal structure
and the orbital degeneracy of VO_2 for a model Hamiltonian where we
focus on just few things. Take the fact that there is a preferred
direction in the unit cell which gives the raise to dimer and build a
single orbital Hubbard model out of it, the Dimer Hubbard Model. It
will capture the key competition between Mott localization due to
coulomb repulsion and the singlet dimerization. We will explore if a
purely electronic transition takes place in this model, for which in
this study the lattice will stay fixed. We will address the question
if this purely electronic transition is of first order as a function
of temperature within a relevant parameter region, having a bearing on
the physics of VO_2. We will explore the physical nature of the
different electronic states and relate our results to key available
experiments.

VO_2 is a very interesting transition metal oxide because it displays
a Metal insulator transition close to room temperature. Making it
attractive for novel electronic devices. Explaining this transition
remains a challenging endeavor, between our hand waving arguments to our
most sophisticated bandstructure calculations great progress has been
made to describe this material but not enough to settle the debate
about the origins of its transition. VO_2 is a correlated metal at
high temperature and one would argue for Mott transition to justify
the insulator, where electrons localize due to the strong Coulomb
repulsion they experience between eachother. Nevertheless at the
transition temperature the crystal structure changes from rutile to
Monoclinic and dimers form and inspire an alternative justification
where the insulating behavior is attributed to this spin-Peierls
structural instability.

For our study we trade the complications of the real crystal structure
and the orbital degeneracy of VO$_2$ for a model Hamiltonian where we
focus on just few things. Take the fact that there is a preferred
direction in the unit cell which gives the raise to dimer and build a
single orbital Hubbard model out of it, the Dimer Hubbard Model. It
will capture the key competition between Mott localization due to
coulomb repulsion and the singlet dimerization. We will explore if a
purely electronic transition takes place in this model, for which in
this study the lattice will stay fixed. We will address the question
if this purely electronic transition is of first order as a function
of temperature within a relevant parameter region, having a bearing on
the physics of VO_2. We will explore the physical nature of the
different electronic states and relate our results to key available
experiments.

The present lattice model as such is currently imposible to solve.
Using Dynamical mean field theory we can treat it as a dimer impurity
problem embedded in a self-consistent bath and solve this alternative
problem exactly. DMFT is exact in infinite dimensions and yields the
generic behavior of a high-dimensional lattice, independent of the
lattice geometry used within the calculation. The energy scales are
renormalized for different geometries and for simplicity we adopt a
semicircular density of state and set the energy unit to its
half-bandwidth $D$.

I first show you a zero temperature phase diagram, where the color
scale is the density of states at the Fermi level and we have captured
the competition between electronic correlations giving rise to the
metal to Mott insulator transition which is first order in character,
as displayed by this hysteresis region. And at the same time the
transition produced by dimerization taking you smoothly from a metal
to a band insulator. The intermediate region conects this two types of
insulator you can still see a first order transition to the mott
insulator and how this is connected to the band insulator

The coexistence region gradually shrinks as temperature is increased.
We recover the well known single-band Hubbard model result, where the
coexistence region is a triangle tilted to the left indicating that
upon heating you cross the first order line from a correlated Metal to
an insulator. This behavior has been associated to the transition in
Cr- doped V_2O_3. As the dimerization strength is increased the
coexistence region changes its tilt towards the right signaling that
dimerization changes the stability of the system. At $t_\perp=0.3$ the
Metal insulator transition is reversed to the previous case enabling
for a low temperature insulator to turn metallic as temperature is
risen just like VO_2.

What can be said about this transition. I'll follow a representative
quatity, the effective dimerization strength which is the bare
dimerization energy enhanced by the real Part of the intersite
self-energy. You can see how it weakly enhances the metal at all
temperatures, but for the insulator it becomes strongly booosted. This
is an electronic dimerization.

What does it look like? Look at the electronic structure of Insulator
within the coexistence region, it has incoherent Hubbard bands which
are the signature of Mott physics. But it also has coherent bands
coexisting.  The metal shows a split quasiparticle
peaks. How does this link to the transition? In the OPtical
conductivity the insulator is quite simple between all interband and
intraband transitions are allowed after overcoming the optical
gap. But I show you the components of this bonding in anti-bonding
bands because in the dimer Metal it gives a new behavior. Aside from
the characteristic Drude response the presence of this split
quasiparticle peak will allow from an inter band transition between
this two and excibit this Mid-Infrared-peak. at 0.22eV.

But are there experiments for this? Yes, this first experiments
conducted in Basov's group they perform Infrared spectroscopy on a VO2
as it is heated accross the transition and measure the optical
conductivity of the Metall puddles that form and have show a response
very different from the high temperature rutile metal. And they show
this MIR peak. Even this new experiments in Martin Dressel group
without pinpointing at the metal puddles at the transtion a generic
view gives you this resonance, which is the signatures of the dimer
metal and our argument why the Mott Mecanins dominates the Insulator
to metal transition in VO2.

If you are doing pump probe experimens on VO2, were you trigger a
photo induced transition know that the dimer metal coexist with the
insulator at all temperatures, look at the optical conductivity and
look for this peak because is strongly frequency dependent.

Thank you for you attention, I'm open for questions now and over this
week. Also I'm looking for PostDoc positions
