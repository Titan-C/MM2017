VO_2 is a very interesting transition metal oxide because it displays
a Metal insulator transition close to room temperature. Making it
attractive for novel electronic devices. Explaining this transition
remains a challenging endeavor, between our hand waving arguments to our
most sophisticated bandstructure calculations great progress has been
made to describe this material but not enough to settle the debate
about the origins of its transition. VO_2 is a correlated metal at
high temperature and one would argue for Mott transition to justify
the insulator, where electrons localize due to the strong Coulomb
repulsion they experience between eachother. Nevertheless at the
transition temperature the crystal structure changes from rutile to
Monoclinic and dimers form and inspire an alternative justification
where the insulating behavior is attributed to this spin-Peierls
structural instability.

For our study we trade the complications of the real crystal structure
and the orbital degeneracy of VO_2 for a model Hamiltonian where we
focus on just few things. Take the fact that there is a preferred
direction in the unit cell which gives the raise to dimer and build a
single orbital Hubbard model out of it, the Dimer Hubbard Model. It
will capture the key competition between Mott localization due to
coulomb repulsion and the singlet dimerization. We will explore if a
purely electronic transition takes place in this model, for which in
this study the lattice will stay fixed. We will address the question
if this purely electronic transition is of first order as a function
of temperature within a relevant parameter region, having a bearing on
the physics of VO_2. We will explore the physical nature of the
different electronic states and relate our results to key available

Good morning everyone. I'm Oscar Najera and do my PhD with Marcelo
Rozenberg in the laboratoire the Physique des solides in Paris. I will
be presenting our work towards resolving the chicken-and-egg problem
in VO_2, and present to you a new paradigm for the Mott transition.

VO_2 is a very interesting transition metal oxide because it displays
a Metal insulator transition close to room temperature. Making it
attractive for novel electronic devices. Explaining this transition
remains a challenging endeavor, between our hand waving arguments to
our most sophisticated bandstructure calculations great progress has
been made to describe this material but not enough to settle the
debate about the origins of its transition. VO_2 is a correlated metal
at high temperature with a rutile crystal structure and one would
argue for a Mott transition to justify the insulating behavior at low
temperatures, where electrons localize due to the strong Coulomb
repulsion they experience between each other.

Nevertheless at the transition temperature the crystal structure
changes from rutile to Monoclinic and dimers form which has inspired
an alternative justification to the insulating behavior and attribute
it to this spin-Peierls structural instability.

For our study we trade the complications of the real crystal structure
and the orbital degeneracy of VO$_2$ for a model Hamiltonian where we
focus on just few things. Take the fact that there is a preferred
direction in the unit cell which gives the raise to dimer and build a
single orbital Hubbard model out of it, the Dimer Hubbard Model. Where
you have electron hopping between the lattice sites, a dimerization
energy and an onsite Hubbard repulsion. This model will capture the
key competition between Mott localization due to Coulomb repulsion and
the singlet dimerization. We will explore if a purely electronic
transition takes place in this model, for which in this study the
lattice will stay fixed. We will address the question if this purely
electronic transition is of first order as a function of temperature
within a relevant parameter region, having a bearing on the physics of
VO_2. We will explore the physical nature of the different electronic
states it presents and relate our results to key available experiments.

The presented lattice model as such is currently imposible to solve.
Using Dynamical mean field theory we can treat it as a dimer impurity
problem embedded in a self-consistent bath which represents the
remaining lattice degrees of freedom in mean-field, we can solve this
alternative problem exactly. DMFT is exact in infinite dimensions and
yields the generic behavior of a high-dimensional lattice, independent
of the lattice geometry used within the calculation. The energy scales
are renormalized for different geometries and for simplicity we adopt
a semicircular density of states and set the energy unit to its
half-bandwidth $D$.

I first show you a zero temperature phase diagram, where the color
scale is the density of states at the Fermi level and we have captured
the competition between electronic correlations which take you from a
Metal here in yellow to a Mott insulator over here in blue as the
onsite interaction strength is increased. This transition is first
order in character, as displayed by this hysteresis region. And at the
same time the transition produced by increasing dimerization takes you
smoothly from a metal to a band insulator. The intermediate region
connects this two insulators. You can still see a first order
transition to the Mott insulator and how this is connected to the band
insulator

When analyzing The coexistence region in temperature we see that it
gradually shrinks as temperature is increased. At zero dimerization we
recover the well known single-band Hubbard model result, where the
coexistence region is a triangle tilted to the left indicating that
upon heating you cross the first order line from a correlated Metal to
an insulator. This behavior has been associated to the transition in
Cr- doped V_2O_3.

As the dimerization strength is increased the coexistence region
changes its tilt towards the right signaling that dimerization changes
the stability of the system. At $t_\perp=0.3$ the Metal insulator
transition is reversed from the previous case enabling for a low
temperature insulator to turn metallic as temperature is risen just
like VO_2.

What can be said about this transition, what makes it different? I'll
follow a representative quatity, the effective dimerization strength
which is the bare dimerization energy enhanced by the real Part of the
intersite self-energy at zero frequency. You can see how it weakly
enhances the metal at all temperatures, but for the insulator it is
strongly boosted as the Mott gap opens at the 1st order
transition. This is an electronic dimerization. The structural
transition is therefore not a reason but is a consequence of the
electronic transition. It is the arrangement of the system after the
electrons prefer to Mott localize.

What does it look like? The electronic structure of Insulator within
the coexistence region, it has incoherent Hubbard bands which are the
signature of Mott physics. But it also has coherent bands coexisting,
they can be linked to those of a lattice if single-dimers. Hence, the
insulator can be characterized as a novel type of Mott-singlet state
where the Hubbard bands have a mix character with both coherent and
incoherent electronic-structure contributions.  The metal shows a
pair of quasiparticle bands crossing the Fermi energy at w=0, and this
quasiparticles can be thought as the renormalization of the
non-interacting bandstructure. At high energies we find the Hubbard
bands, which are signature of Mott physics in the correlated metal.

How does this link to the transition? In the OPtical conductivity the
insulator is quite simple after overcoming the optical gap there is a
response. Interband and intraband transitions between bonding and
anti-bonding bands contribute. I show you the components of this
bonding in anti-bonding bands because in the dimer Metal it gives a
new behavior. Aside from the characteristic Drude response expected
for a Metal the presence of this split quasiparticle peak, one
quasiparticle in the bonding band and other in the antibonding one
will allow from an inter band transition between this two and exhibit
this Mid-Infrared-peak at 0.22eV.

But are there experiments for this? Yes, In this experiment conducted
by Basov's group, they perform Infrared spectroscopy on VO_2 as it is
heated accross the transition. They identify the formation of Metallic
puddles which emerge in the insulating matrix, this phase coexistence
is characteristic of a first order transition. Measurements of the
optical conductivity in the Metallic puddles show a response
significantly different from the high temperature rutile metal, they
show this Mid-infra-red response. This is the signature of the dimer
metal and our argument why the Mott Mechanism dominates the Insulator
to metal transition in VO2


If you are doing pump probe experimens on VO2, were you trigger a
photo induced transition know that the dimer metal coexist with the
insulator at all temperatures, look at the optical conductivity and
look for this peak because is strongly frequency dependent and the
signature of a dimerized metal when the lattice has not yet
experienced any change.

Thank you for you attention, I'm open for questions now and over this
week. You can read more from our recent publication. Also I'm looking
for PostDoc positions
